# Deep Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains deep learning projects implemented from scratch, focusing on fundamental neural network architectures. The goal is to build an intuitive understanding of deep learning by implementing key models without relying on high-level frameworks.

## Implemented Projects
### 1. Perceptron
- A simple neural network for binary classification.
- Implemented from scratch using NumPy.
- Includes training on a toy dataset.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- A basic CNN for image classification.
- Built using NumPy and TensorFlow for comparison.
- Trained on a sample dataset.

## Installation
To run the projects, first clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmadharakeh4/DeepLearning-Notebooks.git
cd Deep-Learning-Notebooks

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
